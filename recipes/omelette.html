        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Welcome! I'll be showing you how to make an omelette in 4 easy steps</p>

        <ol>
            <li> <h2>Get the stuff ready</h2> </li>

        <p>You'll need the follow ingredients:
            <ul>
                <li> Egg </li>
                <li> Salt </li>
                <li> Powdered Pepper </li>
                <li> Oil </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p> You can keep some chilli powder as well, if you like to have a spicy omelette.</p>

        <p> Also, keep a pan, a spoon or a stick to flip the omelette, and a plate.</p>

            <li><h2>Step 2: Pour Oil Onto The Pan</h2></li>

        <p>You will need to pour oil onto the pan after heating the pan for a few minutes.</p>

        <p> Note: Don't forget to wash your utensils before using them! </p>

            <li><h2>Egg and ingredients </h2></li>

        <p> Crack open an egg and put it in the hot pan. Then, add the ingredients one after another. </p>

        <p> The order I would recommend is, first sprinkle a pinch of salt evenly, then some pepper powder, and finally a bit of chilli powder if you to have it spicy. </p>

        <li><h2>Close The Pan, Wait, And Voila! </h2></li>

        <p> After adding all these ingredients, close the pan with plate. </p>

        <p> Wait for a minute or two, then, flip the egg if you prefer to have it cooked well. </p>

        <p> Again, close the pan if you have flipped it so that other side is cooked as well. </p>

        <p> After that, move the egg to a plate to eat. </p>

        </ol>

        <p> There you go! Making an omelette wasn't so hard, was it? </p>
